# Practical 06
# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I’ve started planning my programs more carefully before coding while using more comments and TODOs to outline my steps. I’ve also been running and testing my code more frequently, instead of waiting until the end, which has made debugging much easier and less stressful.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I still need to manage my time better so I can finish each practical earlier in the week. Sometimes I leave things too late and rush through them. I also want to spend more time reading through the style guide and checking that my code follows all conventions before submission.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I have been consistent with testing my code and making sure my output matches the examples. I’ll keep practising writing clean, readable code and adding helpful docstrings.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop rushing through my code without double-checking for small errors or formatting issues. I’ll start reviewing my work more carefully against the style guide before I submit it.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

It would be helpful to have more short video explanations for the harder practicals or assignments, especially ones showing the logic step-by-step. Seeing the reasoning behind the solution would make it easier to understand how to apply the patterns correctly.
