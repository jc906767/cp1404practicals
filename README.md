# CP1404 Practicals

## About
This repository contains my solutions and experiments for the CP1404 subject.  
Author: **Lachlan Blackney (jc906767)**

### What’s here
- Weekly practical exercises and small programs
- Example code following the CP1404 Style Guide
- Notes and small utilities used while learning

## Clean Code Lessons I’ve Learned
- **Small, single-purpose functions** make programs easier to test and reuse.
- **Meaningful, consistent names** (nouns for data, verbs for actions) improve readability.
- **Constants for magic values** reduce duplication and prevent mistakes.
- **Separation of concerns**: keep input/output separate from core logic.
- **Incremental development & refactoring**: write a bit, test a bit, improve a bit.
- **Docstrings and type hints** help others (and future me) understand intent.
- **Validate user input** to avoid crashes and confusing behaviour.
