# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

At the start of the subject my estimates were usually too optimistic. I tended to assume that each prac would only take the minimum amount of time and I didn’t account for debugging, re-reading instructions, or fixing style issues. Sometimes I would underestimate by an hour or more.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

As I completed more prac tasks I started factoring in time for reading, testing and refactoring, not just writing code. My estimates became more realistic and usually ended up within about 10 to 15 minutes of the actual time instead of being wildly off.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned that estimating is a skill, not a guess, and that past work is really useful data. I also realised that breaking a task into smaller chunks makes estimating easier and helps me plan my study sessions better. It also made me more aware of when I was getting stuck and needed to ask for help earlier instead of just hoping it works out.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

From being reviewed, I learned that other people notice different things in my code than I do. Reviewers often picked up on naming, duplication, or style guide issues that I had stopped seeing. It reminded me that code needs to be readable for others, not just working for me.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

From reviewing other people's code I learned how helpful clear, kind and specific feedback can be. It helped me recognise patterns like repeated logic, missing constants and poor variable names. Reviewing also made me reflect on my own code more critically, because I started to notice the same issues in my work.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1
Review on prac_06
[https://github.com/vineetkumarJCU/cp1404practicals/pull/2/files
]()

### Explanation

In this review, I focused on clarity, correctness, and good Python style.
I pointed out places where the code used unnecessary repetition, such as duplicate variable assignments, and suggested cleaner, more efficient alternatives. I also highlighted an incorrect loop implementation and explained why it didn’t work as intended.

### Good Code Review 2
Review on prac_08
[https://github.com/jc943952/CP1404_Practical/pull/4/files]()

### Explanation

In this review, I provided detailed feedback about logic errors and missing cases in the code.
I identified a specific issue where the code would fail under certain inputs due to the loop condition being incorrect, and I explained how to adjust the condition so the program behaved properly. I also gave feedback on variable naming and formatting, encouraging clearer names that follow the style guide.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would make the connection between the weekly pracs and the assignment more obvious. For example, adding a small note at the end of each prac saying: This is a major part of Assignment X. This would have helped me understand why I was learning something and how it would end up fitting into the bigger picture.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I think I did really well at completing the pracs on time. I kept improving my code to follow the style guide, used functions and constants properly, and gradually made my programs cleaner and easier to understand. I also made good use of testing and debugging, especially in the later pracs.
