# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

90%, uncertain but I might have missed one or two in Week 1.

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I mostly watch the lecture videos in the afternoon and try to finish them before the Thursday seminar. If I don't manage to do I try to catch up on them as soon as I have time.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

So far I have been keeping up with the practicals while sticking to the style guide as best I can.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop rushing through practicals just to finish them and instead take more time to reflect on the quality of my code. I should also avoid trying to start the practicals before finishing the lecture videos.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

The number and detail of Git commits. I still haven't gotten used to commiting my code as often or in as much detail as I probably should.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I am making sure that my code runs correctly and meets the requirements before moving on, which means I usually avoid making major errors in my practicals.
